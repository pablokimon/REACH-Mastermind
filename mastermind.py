# Requirements: Python 3 and an internet connection

'''
Mastermind is a command line game based on the boardgame of the same name.
This code was created as part of a seven day coding challenge in February 2020 by Paul Knowles
It does require an internet connection as it implements the random.org random integer generator to create the number combinations to be guessed.

Game rules:

At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of four different numbers from a total of 8 different numbers.
The player will then have 10 chances to correctly guess the pattern.

After each guess attempt, the computer will provide feedback whether the player:
    •had guessed a number correctly, and/or
    •had guessed a number and position correctly.

The computer will not tell you which numbers you guessed correctly, you must use a combination of skill, luck and deductive reasoning to win!

Example game play:
If the pattern was [4,5,6,7]
and you guessed    [7,5,1,2]

The computer will tell you:
Correct Number and Position: 1, Correct Number Only: 1

Which means:
you got one number and position right (5)
you got one number right (7) but in the wrong position

Got it?
